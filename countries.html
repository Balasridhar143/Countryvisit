                <h2>France</h2>
                <p class="desc">France is an endlessly rich travel destination where romance, history, art and
                    gastronomy come together.
                    From the world-class museums of Paris — including the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay — to the narrow lanes
                    of Montmartre, the capital is a study in contrasts and charm.
                    Beyond Paris, rolling wine regions like Bordeaux and Burgundy invite long, leisurely tastings and
                    vineyard tours.
                    Provence’s lavender fields and hilltop villages offer a slower, sensory French pace while the Loire
                    Valley's châteaux reveal Renaissance grandeur.
                    The French Riviera mixes glamour and beaches in Nice and Cannes, while the Alps provide skiing and
                    postcard mountain vistas.
                    Cultural life thrives in café culture, sidewalk markets, and centuries of literature, painting and
                    cinema.
                    Seasonal festivals, from film to music, animate towns across the country and attract international
                    crowds.
                    Dining in France ranges from bistros to Michelin-starred temples of cuisine — food is central to the
                    national identity.
                    Wanderable old towns, lively regional traditions and excellent transport make France easy and
                    rewarding to explore.</p>

            <div class="country-content">
                <h2>Spain</h2>
                <p class="desc">Spain hums with vibrant life, regional diversity and deep historical layers that show in
                    its food, festivals and architecture.
                    Barcelona is a modernist playground where Gaudí’s surreal buildings, including Sagrada Família,
                    punctuate the cityscape.
                    Madrid balances world-class art (the Prado, Reina Sofía) with lively tapas culture and expansive
                    plazas.
                    Andalusia’s whitewashed towns, flamenco rhythms and Moorish palaces — notably the Alhambra in
                    Granada — reveal a layered past.
                    Coastal regions like Costa del Sol and the Balearic Islands offer golden beaches, clear seas and a
                    relaxed party-and-rest mix.
                    Inland landscapes include the green mountains of the north, the Rioja vineyards and the Camino de
                    Santiago pilgrimage routes.
                    Spanish cuisine ranges from humble tapas to refined cuisine, reflecting rich local produce and long
                    culinary traditions.
                    Annual festivals from La Tomatina to Semana Santa create memorable, high-energy experiences for
                    visitors.
                    Warm plazas, lively markets and a relaxed afternoon rhythm make Spain both intensely social and
                    deeply historic.</p>

                <h2>United States</h2>
                <p class="desc">The United States covers an immense variety of landscapes, cultures and city experiences
                    across its fifty states.
                    New York City is a global crossroads of art, finance and theatre, while cities like Los Angeles,
                    Chicago and New Orleans each offer distinct local flavors.
                    Natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Everglades showcase dramatic
                    geography and biodiversity.
                    California’s coastline provides beaches, vineyards and Silicon Valley’s tech hubs; the Rocky
                    Mountains and Pacific Northwest offer outdoor adventure.
                    American cuisine reflects centuries of cultural mixing — regional barbecue, seafood, southern
                    comfort food and immigrant-driven neighborhoods.
                    National parks, scenic drives and small towns make road-trip culture uniquely American and endlessly
                    discoverable.
                    Cultural exports like film, music and sports influence the world while local festivals and
                    communities retain regional character.
                    Historic sites from colonial towns to civil rights landmarks help tell the nation's complex story.
                    Practical infrastructure for travelers is strong in major corridors, and adventurous routes reward
                    those willing to explore beyond the cities.</p>

                <h2>Italy</h2>
                <p class="desc">Italy is a treasure trove of art, history and culinary delights, with every region
                    offering a distinct personality.
                    Rome’s ancient ruins — the Colosseum and Roman Forum — share space with Vatican art and Baroque
                    piazzas.
                    Florence is a Renaissance open-air museum filled with masterpieces, while Venice’s canals and
                    palazzos evoke romance and mystery.
                    The Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre provide dramatic coastal roads and cliffside villages with
                    spectacular sea views.
                    Tuscany’s rolling vineyards, hilltop villages and farm-to-table traditions make it ideal for slow
                    travel and food experiences.
                    Northern Italy is home to fashion and design in Milan, and the Alpine lakes provide refined escape
                    and outdoor sports.
                    Italian cuisine is regionally specific — from Neapolitan pizza to Ligurian pesto and Venetian
                    seafood — and meals are the heart of social life.
                    Historic festivals, artisan workshops and ancient cathedrals make Italy endlessly enjoyable for
                    explorers and culture lovers.
                    Compact historic centers, great train connections and a focus on local produce make Italy one of the
                    world’s most beloved destinations.</p>

                <p class="desc">China spans vast landscapes and millennia of civilization, offering layered cultural and
                    natural experiences.
                    From Beijing’s Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square to the Great Wall's sweeping watchtowers,
                    imperial history is prominent.
                    Shanghai’s skyline and bustling Bund show modern China’s global financial energy and cosmopolitan
                    lifestyle.
                    The southern regions feature lush karst scenery in Guilin and ancient towns like Lijiang, while
                    Sichuan tempts with spicy cuisine and panda reserves.
                    Xi’an houses the incredible Terracotta Army and offers an entry into China’s ancient imperial past.
                    Regional cuisines vary dramatically — Cantonese dim sum, Sichuan pepper heat, and northern
                    wheat-based specialties all tell local stories.
                    Traditional festivals, tea culture, and classical gardens show centuries of refined cultural
                    practices.
                    Rapid urban development coexists with remote villages and dramatic nature, making travel across
                    China endlessly varied.
                    Practical rail and flight networks connect major hubs, while local markets and handicrafts provide

                    London is a sprawling global city with museums, theatres, palaces and diverse neighborhoods offering
                    food and culture from around the world.
                    The English countryside — the Cotswolds, Lake District and Yorkshire Dales — provides rolling hills,
                    historic estates and walking routes.
                    Scotland’s Highlands offer rugged mountains, lochs and castles, while Edinburgh’s festivals and
                    medieval Old Town captivate visitors.
                    Wales pairs dramatic coastline and reclaimed industrial landscapes with Celtic culture and heritage.
                    Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast provides unique geological features and picturesque coastal towns.
                    Tea houses, markets and centuries of literature and music shape daily life; pub culture remains an
                    essential social fabric.
                    Historic sites like Stonehenge, Bath, and Hampton Court offer glimpses of Britain’s layered past.

                <p class="desc">Portugal charms with historic Lisbon, port wine in Porto, golden beaches in the Algarve
                    and a relaxed Atlantic culture. Lisbon’s hills, trams and viewpoints reveal pastel-colored
                    neighborhoods, fado music and maritime history. Porto’s riverside district is famous for port
                    cellars, tiled facades and lively culinary scenes. The Algarve offers dramatic cliffs, hidden coves
                    and beach towns ideal for sun, surf and fresh seafood. Inland, the Douro Valley’s terraced vineyards
                    produce world-class wines and scenic river cruises. Portugal’s rustic cuisine, pastries like pastéis
                    de nata and local seafood celebrate the Atlantic bounty. Small towns, historic monasteries and
                    coastal walks make the country easy to explore by car or train. Friendly locals, affordable travel
                    options and a mild climate round out Portugal’s strong appeal as a varied European destination.</p>

                    perfect for road trips. Kruger National Park and private game reserves provide world-class safari
                    opportunities and chances to see the Big Five up close. South Africa’s cultural tapestry includes
                    vibrant townships, rich musical traditions and a complex history that shapes contemporary life.
                    Local cuisine blends indigenous, colonial and immigrant influences into diverse regional flavors.
